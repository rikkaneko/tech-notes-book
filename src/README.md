## About Me
I am an university student with great interest in computer science and open source projects.  
I am learning a new language _Rust_ recently. That is such a great system programming language with safety checks to replace C++.  
I am also big fan of anime!  
_**Btw, I use Arch and I am a KDE User!**_
